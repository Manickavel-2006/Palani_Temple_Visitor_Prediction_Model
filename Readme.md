Visitor Prediction Model for Palani Murugan Temple

Overview:
This project demonstrates a Machine Learning model that predicts the number of visitors to the Palani Murugan Temple based on a custom dataset created for real-world analysis.  

Key Features:
- Uses Supervised Learning (Regression)
- Predicts temple visitor count based on historical and contextual data
- Demonstrates the end-to-end ML workflow:
  1. Data collection & cleaning  
  2. Exploratory data analysis  
  3. Model training (Regression)  
  4. Evaluation and visualization  

Tech Stack:
- Language: Python  
- Tools: Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- Model: Linear Regression

Dataset:
A custom dataset was created containing visitor-related information such as:
- Date, Day, Month, Weeks
- Weather, Temparature
- holidays, special_features
- Number of visitors  

How to Run:
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.  
2. Upload the dataset (if not included).  
3. Run all cells sequentially to train and test the model.  
4. Observe visualizations and predictions.  

Use:
The model successfully predicts the approximate number of visitors to the temple with good accuracy.
